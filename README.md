# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my project â€” this is the frontend component of an experimental project I'm currently working on called Rival News. Powered by React, LLMs, and analytics, Rival News is a new take on written news media. With a set of core facts written by our authors, we generate news articles using various LLM models and processes. We continuously re-write and test the wording of our articles to maximize shareability.

## Front-end Architecture

Our frontend uses:

- React
- Vite
- Tailwinds
- NextUI

## Back-end

We are using GCP data connect to manage our PostgreSQL database and automatically generate schemas and the web SDK which allows us to bypass having a typicall REST API layer, streamlining our data handling processes and improving efficiency.

It is recommended that you download the Firebase Data Connect extension for testing and building.
