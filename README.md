# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my project â€” this is the frontend component of an experimental project I'm currently working on called Rival News. Powered by React, LLMs, and analytics, Rival News is a new take on written news media. With a set of core facts written by our authors, we generate news articles using various LLM models and processes. We continuously re-write and test the wording of our articles to maximize shareability.

## Front-end Architecture

Our frontend uses:
- React
- Vite
- Tailwinds
- NextUI
