    <p>In a significant cyberattack this month, hackers compromised the personal information of over 31 million users of the Internet Archive, the world's largest digital archive of internet content. The breach exposed user email addresses and encrypted passwords, according to "Have I Been Pwned," a website that tracks data breaches.</p>

    <p>The Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, is renowned for its mission of providing "universal access to all knowledge" through its vast digital library of websites, software, and printed materials. Despite the breach, the nonprofit confirmed that its extensive archival material remains secure.</p>

    <p>Following the attack, the Internet Archive temporarily shut down its services to assess and improve its security measures. As of Friday, many core services, including its popular Wayback Machine, were back online. The organization is taking a cautious approach to restoring other services, which will initially be available in read-only mode as they work to fully secure the platform.</p>

    <p>Visitors to the site first became aware of the breach on October 9, when a defaced JavaScript message appeared, warning users that the Internet Archive had been hacked. The message referred to "31 million of you" being affected and linked to the "Have I Been Pwned" site.</p>

    <p>In a blog post, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle reassured users that the organization is working around the clock to rebuild and strengthen its defenses. Kahle also noted that this is the second cyberattack the nonprofit has faced since its founding in 1996, with the first occurring earlier this year in May.</p>

    <p>The attack on the Internet Archive is part of a broader trend of cyberattacks targeting libraries. Kahle pointed out that other institutions, including the British Library, Seattle Public Library, Toronto Public Library, and Calgary Public Library, have also suffered from similar attacks recently.</p>

    <p>In addition to these cyber threats, the Internet Archive has been entangled in legal battles over its digitization of copyrighted books and music. The potential financial burden from these lawsuits, Kahle warned, could be devastating for the nonprofit.</p>

    <p>The Internet Archive has not yet released further details about the breach or its impact on individual users, but Kahle emphasized that security remains the organization's top priority as it works to restore full functionality.</p>
